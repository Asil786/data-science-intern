# Data Science Intern

As a **Data Science Intern**, I gained hands-on experience in analyzing large datasets, building predictive models, and deriving actionable insights using statistical and machine learning techniques. During my internship, I contributed to real-world projects by:

- Cleaning, processing, and visualizing structured and unstructured data to uncover trends and patterns.
- Developing machine learning models to solve business problems, including regression, classification, and clustering tasks.
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to implement data-driven solutions and optimize decision-making processes.
- Utilizing tools and frameworks such as **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Tableau**.
- Documenting findings and presenting results through dashboards, reports, and visualizations to stakeholders.

This experience enhanced my technical expertise in data science, strengthened my problem-solving abilities, and fostered a passion for collaboration and continuous learning.
