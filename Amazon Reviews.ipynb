No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock.

I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it.
