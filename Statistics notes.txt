*IQR- Intetr Quartile range.
From the median of 25% value from both the side of the median is first and second quarter and the other values is outliers.
*Covariance -How one value is changing with the other value, its always in the number subtract from the mean value which is denoted by X and Y
*Correlation -Covariance / Standard deviation
*Supervised-
